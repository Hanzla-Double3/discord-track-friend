# discord-track-friend
Well, I ain't made this. There is this person lives inside me who want to stalk others. He thinks he can automate everthing.

Its just look if a person is in your friend list or not after every 3 hours. If not It sent notification on your phone

# Configure
Go pushbullet.com -> signup -> get api key

Put that api key in file "secrets.json"

Go to appstore/playstore -> install pushbullet app -> login

Go to browser (Windows/Linux) -> discord.com -> login -> press ctrl+shift+i -> network tab -> op1:click any request -> look for "authorization" value under request header (if 404 go to op1 )

Go to that person profile you want to track -> copy its user id (if option 404 go to instruct n)

Instruction n: I don't know, look up on internet, You might have to enable developer mode or something

Put that code in "secrets.json"

Run the code 

secrets.json
```
{
    "DISCORD_TOKEN":"I aint pasting mine here",
    "USERID":"Naah dude no chance",
    "PUSH_BULLET_TOKEN":"It's not that important but still i dont want to risk"
}
```

Happy Stalking
